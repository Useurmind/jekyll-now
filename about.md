I launched this site in 2018 to share my thoughts about software development.

If you are interested in designing innovative and useful software you will surely find some ideas here interesting.

### About me

My name is Jochen and I am a professional software developer since 2009.

I live in Germany near Stuttgart and like to design software libraries that make our
lives as developers easier.
